<font color=white><h1>Errant Venture Terms of Service</h1>

<p>It has become nessisary to state the terms of service for using this platform.</P>

<p>1) no swearing or using lewd language, yes there is a language filter to catch the odd oops, but trying to defeat the language filter when there is an on off switch is grounds for banning</p>

<p>2) don't provoke the moderators</p>
<p>3) treat other gamers with respect</p>
<p>4) take your personal disputes somewhere else, no one wants to hear it</P>
<p>5) have fun</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Thats about it, imagine that you are all in a public park with a local cop strolling by, any action that would get you a rap on the noggin and a ride to the clink in RL will not be tolerated within EV</p>
